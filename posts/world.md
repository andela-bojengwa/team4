## Soldier Daddy

To you I may be very small
Or think I don't know much at all
I've learned to grow up rather fast
With so much future and not much past

I'm just two years old but often sad
I want so much to hug my dad
He's protecting us from far away
His life on the line everyday

I watch my mom and see her cry
I already know but still ask why?
Her heart is hurting yet she tries to smile
And we hold each other for a little while

I'm still young yet very wise
I have my fun but realize
My soldier daddy is brave and strong
I pray his deployment won't be long
